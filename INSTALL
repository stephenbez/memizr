These installation instructions have only been tested on Ubuntu 10.04.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi mysql-client mysql-server php5 phpmyadmin python-django python-mysqldb

Edit django.wsgi and modify the absolute paths to match the path on your machine.

Add the following two lines (with the path updated to your path) to the bottom of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:
WSGIScriptAlias / /home/steve/spacedRepetition/spacedRepetition/django.wsgi
Alias /site_media/ /home/steve/spacedRepetition/spacedRepetition/flashcards/site_media/

Restart apache:
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Follow these directions: http://parand.com/say/index.php/2008/06/11/djangomysql-how-to-fix-unicode-aka-mysterious-question-marks/

Go to phpmyadmin and create a new user.
Create a database called spaced_repetition.

Change settings.py so the database settings match this new user.  Also change STATIC_DOC_ROOT to match your path.

Create the directory /var/log/django, and chown so django can write to it.

python manage.py syncdb

At this point you should be ready to go.
Go to localhost/home to see if it works.

If you encounter any problems, a good place to check is /var/log/apache2/error.log
