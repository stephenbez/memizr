TODO:
- Better description of what Memizr is on homepage
- Better css styling for login/register
- When you have no cards and click edit, it should display an message
- When you register, it should not make you also login

- look into problems with MySQL accepted unicode strings

- Instead of just saying no cards currently available, say the next card will be available in 3 days.
- be able to define when the day ends (or switch from a day based approach to a time based approach)

- better support for formatting of the question, if you put source code in the text box, when it is displayed, everything is on one line

- better server side logging to debug potential problems

- Add tags
- Do input checking so people can't add blank cards
- Maybe, do input checking so people can't add cards that have already been there
- ability to add pictures/sounds, maybe LaTeX formulas
- email people when they have cards available for reviewing
- If a person has ZERO cards, when they go to Review, should tell them to go add some cards
- When someone is in review mode, then edits the current card, it should probably take them back to review mode instead of edit mode

Optional:
Add ability to import/export cards
